= External Sorting

== Definition
Java implementation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting[External Sorting] algorithm.   
This implementation will look for a file named `input.txt` in the root of this project and will produce a file named `output.txt`.
 
== Hint
To generate a sample file just execute the following command in any *nix OS.

```
ruby -e 'a=STDIN.readlines;5000000.times do;b=[];16.times do; b << a[rand(a.size)].chomp end; puts b.join(" "); end' < /usr/share/dict/words > input.txt
```
